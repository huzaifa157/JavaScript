// ðŸŸ¢ What is an Identifier?

// ðŸ‘‰ An identifier is the name you give to variables, functions, classes, etc.

// Identifier Rules

// All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names (identifiers).

// Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. (no space)

// Names must begin with a letter.

// Names can also begin with $ and _.

// Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).

// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) CANNOT be used as names.
